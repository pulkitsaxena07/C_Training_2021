Minimum number to form the sum even 
Basic Accuracy: 55.02% Submissions: 13511 Points: 1
Given an array arr[] of size N, the task is to add the minimum number(should be greater than 0) to the array so that the sum of the array becomes even

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 8
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Output:  2
Explanation:  Sum of array is 36, so 
we add minimum number 2 to make the 
sum even.

Example 2:

Input: N = 9
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Output:  1
 

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You don't need to take any input, as it is already accomplished by the driver code. You just need to complete the function minNum() that takes array A and integer N as parameters and returns the minimum number required to the array so that the sum becomes even.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N). 
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
