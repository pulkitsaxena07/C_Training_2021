Set all odd bits 
Basic Accuracy: 51.41% Submissions: 142 Points: 1
Given a number, the task is to set all odd bits of a number.
NOTE: Position of Least Significant Bit is considered as 1.

Example 1:

Input: n = 20
Output: 21 
Explanation: Binary representation of 20 
is 10100. Setting all odd bits make the 
number 10101 which is binary
representation of 21.
Example 2:

Input: n = 10
Output: 15
Explanation: Binary representation of 10
is 1010. Setting all odd bits make the
number 1111 which is binary representation
of 15.

Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function setAllOddBitsâ€‹() which takes n as input parameter and returns the modified number.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1<= n <=109
